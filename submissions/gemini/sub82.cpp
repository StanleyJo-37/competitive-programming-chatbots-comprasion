        // To make all breakfasts taken, for every 'j', for all 'i' with C_i < C_j, we must have A_i < A_j.
        // This implies that if we arrange all breakfasts in increasing order of cost, say $B_1, B_2, ..., B_N$ such that $C_{B_1} < C_{B_2} < ... < C_{B_N}$,
        // then we must have $A_{B_1} < A_{B_2} < ... < A_{B_N}$.
        // If this condition holds, no breakfast can be overshadowed. Why?
        // Suppose $B_j$ is overshadowed by $B_i$. Then $A_{B_i} \ge A_{B_j}$ and $C_{B_i} < C_{B_j}$.
