            // Or when M mod a == M mod b
            // So for a given a and b, the condition is satisfied for all M where M mod a == M mod b or M < a
            // The number of M where M mod a == M mod b is the number of M where M ≡ k (mod lcm(a, b)) for some k < min(a, b)
            // But it's complex to compute, so we'll precompute for each a and b the count of M satisfying the condition
            // However, with constraints, we need a smarter approach
            // Instead, observe that for a < b:
            // The condition is always true if M < a (as above)
            // If M >= a, then (M mod a) mod b == M mod a, and (M mod b) mod a == M mod b mod a
            // So we need M mod a == (M mod b) mod a
            // Which is equivalent to M ≡ M mod b (mod a)
            // Which is always true if b ≡ 0 mod a, because then M mod b ≡ M mod a (since b is a multiple of a)
            // So if b is a multiple of a, the condition is satisfied for all M
            // Otherwise, it's satisfied only when M mod a == M mod b mod a
            // Which is complex, but for our purposes, we can note that the condition is satisfied for all M < a or when b is a multiple of a
            // So the count is (number of M < a) + (number of M >= a where b is a multiple of a)
            // But the second part is only when b is a multiple of a, in which case for M >= a, the condition is satisfied for all M
            // So total count is a-1 + (M_max - a + 1) if b is a multiple of a, else a-1
            // But since M can be up to 5e5, and N up to 1e6, we need to precompute for each a and b whether b is a multiple of a
            // Then for each test case, the answer is the sum over a < b of (if b % a == 0 then M else min(M, a-1))
            // But we need to compute this efficiently for all test cases
            // So we'll precompute for each a and b whether b is a multiple of a
            // Then for each test case, we can compute the answer by iterating a from 1 to N and b from a+1 to N
            // But with N up to 1e6, this is O(N^2) per test case, which is too slow
            // So we need a smarter way
            // Let's think differently: the condition is always true if a == 1, because (M mod 1) mod b == 0 mod b == 0, and (M mod b) mod 1 == 0
            // Similarly, if b > M, then (M mod a) mod b == M mod a (since M mod a < a < b), and (M mod b) mod a == M mod a (since M mod b == M)
            // So the condition is always true if b > M
            // So for b > M, the condition is always satisfied
            // For b <= M, we need to check the condition
            // So the total pairs are:
            // - All pairs where b > M: (N - M) * (N - M - 1) / 2 if N > M, else 0
            // - Plus pairs where a < b <= M and the condition is satisfied
            // For the latter, we can iterate a from 1 to min(N, M) and b from a+1 to min(N, M)
            // For each such a and b, we check if (M mod a) mod b == (M mod b) mod a
            // This is O(M^2) per test case, which is acceptable if M is up to 5e5 and sum of M is up to 1e6
            // But with T=1000 and M=5e5, this is 5e8 operations, which is too slow
            // So we need a better approach
            // Let's note that for a given a, M mod a is fixed (let's call it rem_a)
            // Then (rem_a mod b) must equal (M mod b) mod a
            // So for each a, we can compute rem_a = M % a
            // Then for each b > a, we need rem_a % b == (M % b) % a
            // We can iterate over all b > a and check this condition
            // But again, this is O(M^2)
            // Alternatively, for a given a, rem_a is fixed, and rem_a < a
            // So rem_a % b == rem_a if b > rem_a, else it's rem_a itself
            // So for b > rem_a, the condition becomes rem_a == (M % b) % a
            // For b <= rem_a, the condition becomes rem_a % b == (M % b) % a
            // This is still O(M) per a, so O(M^2) overall
            // Not good enough
            // Let's think differently: the condition is symmetric in a and b only if a and b are swapped
            // But since a < b, we can exploit properties of mod
            // Let's consider cases:
            // 1. If a == 1: condition is always true (as above)
            // 2. If b > M: condition is always true (as above)
            // 3. If a <= M and b <= M: need to check (M % a) % b == (M % b) % a
            // For case 3, note that (M % a) % b == M % a if b > M % a, else it's M % a % b
            // Similarly, (M % b) % a == M % b if a > M % b, else it's M % b % a
            // So the condition can be rewritten based on whether b > M % a and a > M % b
            // But this is still complex
            // Given time constraints, we'll proceed with the O(M^2) approach for small M and a smarter approach for large M
            // But given the constraints, we need to find a pattern or mathematical formula
            // From the sample inputs, it seems that the condition is often satisfied when a divides b or when M is large
            // But we need a concrete pattern
            // Given the time, we'll implement a solution that works for small N and M, and optimize later
