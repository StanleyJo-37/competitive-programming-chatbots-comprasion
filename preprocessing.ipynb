For example, for $n = 4$ number $17$ is special, because it can be written as $4^0 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17$, but $9$ is not.\\n\\nTheofanis asks you to help him find the $k$-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo $10^9+7$.\\n\\n\\n-----Input-----\\n\\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.\\n\\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \\\\le n \\\\le 10^9$; $1 \\\\le k \\\\le 10^9$).\\n\\n\\n-----Output-----\\n\\nFor each test case, print one integer — the
